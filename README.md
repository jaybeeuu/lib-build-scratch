# Library Build Investigation

This repo is an investigatino in to the build techniques and package content of some react component libraries.

I looked at:

- [material-ui](./material-ui.md)
- [semantic-ui-react](./semantic-ui-react,md)
- [reactstrap](./reactstrap.md)
- [react-toolbox](./react-toolbox.md)

The adhoc and notesy analysis is given in the MD files linked.

There is no runnable code in this repo, but if you wnat to have a look at the package content for each then you can pull this down and install the dependencies. (I used `pnpm` because it leaves a cleaner `node_modules`.)

```sh
pnpm install
```
